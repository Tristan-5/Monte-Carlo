This file provides the Python code used to perform the Monte Carlo simulation for validating the kinetic molecular collision model of turbulence. 
In the simulation, each particle’s trajectory is computed by summing the outcomes of independent collision events, where each collision imparts a displacement of ±pm the step size. 
The resulting distribution of net displacements is compared with the theoretical Gaussian distribution predicted by the Central Limit Theorem.
In this simulation, each collision is modeled as an independent random step that displaces a particle by either +s or -s, where s is a constant step size. 
For a particle undergoing n collisions, the cumulative net displacement X is the sum of these individual steps. 
According to the Central Limit Theorem, the net displacement should follow a Gaussian (normal) distribution with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of √ns.
The simulation was implemented in Python and simulated 10,000 particles, each undergoing 1,000 collisions. 
The resulting histogram of net displacements (Figure 2) shows a bell-shaped distribution that closely aligns with the theoretical Gaussian probability density function. 
The empirical mean was found to be nearly zero, and the empirical standard deviation matched the predicted value of √1000  ×1.0. 
This excellent agreement supports our model’s hypothesis that turbulence emerges from the cumulative effect of numerous independent molecular collisions.
